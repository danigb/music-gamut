`music-gamut` is a javascript library to manipulate notes (or intervals):

```js
gamut.pitchSet('C2 D3 C4 E5') // => ['C', 'D', 'E']
gamut.transpose('2M', 'C D E F G') // => ['D', 'E', 'F#', 'G', 'A']
gamut.distances('C2', 'C3 C4') // => ['8P', '15P']
```

It's fast, easy and side-effects free (all pure functions).

## Install

For node users: `npm i --save music-gamut`. For browser users, use webpack, browserify or similar tool.

## Usage

In `music-gamut`, a gamut is list of notes or intervals. The list can be expressed as arrays or as strings separated by spaces, commas or bars:

```js
gamut(['C', 'D', 'E']) // => ['C', 'D', 'E']
gamut('C D E') // => ['C', 'D', 'E']
gamut('C | D | E') // => ['C', 'D', 'E']
gamut('C, D, E') // => ['C', 'D', 'E']
```

You can use the functions `notes` and `intervals` and to filter the type:

```js
gamut.notes('C2 blah D3') // => ['C2', null, 'D3']
gamut.intervals('1 2 3 blah 4 5') // => ['1P', '2M', '3M', null, '4P', '5P']
```

You have a collection of funtions to manipulate the lists. All the functions returns a new copy of the list (no mutations):

- transpose: transpose a list of notes by an interval
- add: add an interval to a list of intervals
- distances: get distances of the gamut from a note
- pitchSet: get the pitch set from the gamut
- intervalSet: get the interval set from the gamut
- uniq: remove duplicates and nulls
- pitchClasses: remove the octaves from the notes
